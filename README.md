# Mastermind

This is a C# console application for playing a simple version of the game Mastermind, as specified by the Quadax application programming exercise. 


## Notes

Thank you for checking out my submission! I really enjoyed figuring out the most efficient solution, take a look at the comments in the code to see how I traded some memory for time efficiency. I also included configurable settings for the game at the top of the method and kept that in mind while writing out the program. Look at your debug output to cheat and see the correct answer!
